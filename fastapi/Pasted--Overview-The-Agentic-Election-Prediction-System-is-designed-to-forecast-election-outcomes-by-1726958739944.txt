    response = await asyncio.to_thread(requests.get, api_endpoint)
    return response.json()

async def ingest_data(endpoints):
    tasks = [fetch_data(endpoint) for endpoint in endpoints]
    data = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return data
```

**Description**: Asynchronously fetches data from multiple API endpoints using `asyncio` to improve efficiency and reduce latency.

### Data Processing Algorithm

```python
import pandas as pd

def clean_data(raw_data):
    df = pd.DataFrame(raw_data)
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    df = df.applymap(lambda x: x.strip() if isinstance(x, str) else x)
    return df

def normalize_data(df):
    normalized_df = (df - df.mean()) / df.std()
    return normalized_df
```

**Description**: Cleans the raw data by removing missing values and stripping whitespace, then normalizes numerical features to ensure consistency across datasets.

### Prediction Algorithm

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

def train_model(X, y):
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X, y)
    joblib.dump(model, 'models/election_model.pkl')
    return model

def load_model():
    return joblib.load('models/election_model.pkl')

def predict(model, X):
    return model.predict(X)
```

**Description**: Trains a Random Forest classifier on the processed data, saves the trained model, and provides functions to load and use the model for predictions.

### Optimization Algorithm

```python
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    n_estimators = trial.suggest_int('n_estimators', 50, 200)
    max_depth = trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 5, 30)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators, max_depth=max_depth, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model.score(X_valid, y_valid)

def optimize_model():
    study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize')
