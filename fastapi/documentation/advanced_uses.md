# Advanced Uses of the Agentic Election Prediction System

## Introduction

This document provides advanced use cases and examples for the Agentic Election Prediction System. It includes instructions on how to use the system for real-time election monitoring and how to integrate the system with other applications.

## Real-Time Election Monitoring

### Overview

Real-time election monitoring involves continuously collecting, processing, and analyzing data to provide up-to-date predictions and insights. This can be particularly useful during election periods when timely information is critical.

### Steps for Real-Time Monitoring

1. **Set Up Data Ingestion**:
   - Ensure that the data ingestion agent is configured to fetch data from relevant sources at regular intervals.
   - Use asynchronous data fetching to minimize latency.

2. **Continuous Data Processing**:
   - Set up the data processing agent to clean and normalize the ingested data in real-time.
   - Ensure that the processed data is stored in a format suitable for immediate analysis.

3. **Real-Time Analysis and Prediction**:
   - Deploy the analysis and prediction agents to continuously analyze the processed data and generate predictions.
   - Use a message queue or event bus to handle real-time data flow between agents.

4. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Implement a dashboard to visualize real-time predictions and insights.
   - Use webhooks to trigger alerts and notifications based on specific events or thresholds.

### Example Code for Real-Time Monitoring

```python
import asyncio
from agents.data_ingestion import ingest_data
from agents.data_processing import process_data
from agents.analysis import analyze_data
from agents.prediction import train_model, make_prediction

async def real_time_monitoring():
    while True:
        # Ingest data
        raw_data = await ingest_data()
        
        # Process data
        processed_data = process_data(raw_data)
        
        # Analyze data
        analysis_results = analyze_data(processed_data)
        
        # Generate predictions
        model = train_model(processed_data)
        predictions = [make_prediction(model, data) for data in processed_data]
        
        # Visualize and report
        print("Real-Time Predictions:", predictions)
        
        # Wait for the next interval
        await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Adjust the interval as needed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(real_time_monitoring())
```

## Integration with Other Applications

### Overview

Integrating the Agentic Election Prediction System with other applications can enhance its functionality and provide additional insights. This section provides instructions on how to integrate the system with external applications.

### Steps for Integration

1. **API Integration**:
   - Use the provided API endpoints to interact with the prediction system from external applications.
   - Ensure that the API is properly authenticated and secured.

2. **Data Exchange**:
   - Implement data exchange mechanisms to send and receive data between the prediction system and external applications.
   - Use standardized data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) for compatibility.

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Use webhooks or message queues to trigger actions based on specific events or conditions.
   - Implement an event bus to handle real-time communication between the prediction system and external applications.

### Example Code for API Integration

```python
import requests

# Example function to create a prediction using the API
def create_prediction(candidate, probability):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predictions/"
    payload = {"candidate": candidate, "probability": probability}
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()

# Example function to read predictions using the API
def read_predictions():
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predictions/"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

# Example function to update a prediction using the API
def update_prediction(prediction_id, candidate, probability):
    url = f"http://127.0.0.1:8000/predictions/{prediction_id}"
    payload = {"candidate": candidate, "probability": probability}
    response = requests.put(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()

# Example function to delete a prediction using the API
def delete_prediction(prediction_id):
    url = f"http://127.0.0.1:8000/predictions/{prediction_id}"
    response = requests.delete(url)
    return response.json()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a new prediction
    new_prediction = create_prediction("Test Candidate", 0.75)
    print("Created Prediction:", new_prediction)
    
    # Read all predictions
    predictions = read_predictions()
    print("All Predictions:", predictions)
    
    # Update a prediction
    updated_prediction = update_prediction(new_prediction["id"], "Updated Candidate", 0.8)
    print("Updated Prediction:", updated_prediction)
    
    # Delete a prediction
    deleted_prediction = delete_prediction(new_prediction["id"])
    print("Deleted Prediction:", deleted_prediction)
```
